Project Description: This project is a "Test Score Calculator" program that is created in assembly programming, using an LC-3 Simulator through the editor and the simulator.
The "Test Score Calculator" contains the following criteria:
1. Appropriate addresses: origination, fill, array, input and output
2. Display minimum, maximum, average values and grades in console
3. Appropriate labels and comments
4. Appropriate instructions for arithmetic, data movement and conditional operations
5. Comprise of 2 or more subroutines and implement subroutine calls
6. Use branching for control: conditional and iterative
7. Manage overflow and storage allocation
8. Manage stack: include PUSH-POP operation on stack
9. Include save-restore operations
10. Include pointer
11. Implement ASCII conversion operations
12. Use appropriate system call directives
13. Testing - test the program using the values: 52, 87, 96, 79, 61

Purpose of the Program: To create an LC-3 program that will display the maximum, minimum, average score and the letter grade equivelance (0-50=F, 60-69=D, 70-79=C, 80-89=B, 90-100=A).

Creator Names: Kevin Chavez, Julissa Mota, Jasmine Gaona, Brian Cabrera

Version Number: 1.0

Date of Creation: 4 June, 2020

Program Usage Instruction: Through the LC-3 Simulator, Run the program and instructions will be displayed through the Console. The Console will instruct the user to input 5 test scores, then it will display the ouput, which is the maximum, minimum, average score and the letter grade equivelance (0-50=F, 60-69=D, 70-79=C, 80-89=B, 90-100=A).
